        <div class="subheading mb-5">English Professor and Writer</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4"> I am an English professor seeking work. My past experience includes an MXDWN internship writing for their weekly Sunday news, which I currently still have. Additionally, I had an internship where I assisted students on the spectrum. Both of these jobs required patience and understanding. I have a long history in the department of English, as I have always been fond of it. Two of my poems have been uploaded and published on the Pomona Valley Review.
As an English Professor with years of experience in higher education, I have focused on helping students develop a love for literature and strong writing abilities. At  the University of California Riverside, I taught various courses, including English composition, American and British literature, and creative writing. I adapted my teaching methods to meet the diverse needs of my students, ensuring that everyone felt included and engaged. By creating an inviting classroom environment, I encouraged active participation and thoughtful discussions about the texts we studied. I also developed creative curricula that combined contemporary literature with digital resources, helping students grasp complex themes and improve their critical thinking skills.<br><br>

        Mentoring students has been a key part of my role. I guided academic pathways and supported many students with their research projects, resulting in publications and presentations at national conferences. I used a range of assessment methods, such as peer reviews and reflective writing assignments, to measure student progress. These approaches not only assessed their work but also encouraged personal growth and self-reflection, significantly boosting their writing skills and confidence.
I am committed to my own professional growth as well. I regularly participate in workshops and conferences to learn about the latest teaching strategies and literary research. This dedication to improvement not only benefits me but also inspires my colleagues. I often share new ideas and insights during departmental meetings, contributing to discussions on how we can enhance our curriculum and better engage our students.
Additionally, I have been actively involved in community outreach programs aimed at promoting literacy and the arts. I organized events that connected students with local writers through readings and workshops, enriching our academic community and fostering a greater appreciation for literature outside the classroom.<br><br>

        Throughout my career, I have been recognized for creating a positive and engaging learning atmosphere. I am excited to bring my experience in literature and composition to a new academic institution. My goal is to inspire students to unlock their creative potential and develop critical analytical skills, preparing them for success in their academic and professional lives. With a strong record of effective teaching and a passion for student development, I look forward to contributing to a vibrant academic community that values excellence in education.
I hope that I can continue my journey as an English professor and expand my career even further that what I am normally used to. I am always open to trying new things as I find myself to be a very flexible person. The future has so much more in store for us all than we think!
